# How to Add Your Architecture Diagram

## Steps:

1. **Save your diagram image** as `architecture-diagram.png`

2. **Place it in the `docs/` folder** of your repository

3. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add docs/architecture-diagram.png
   git commit -m "Add architecture diagram"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **The README will automatically display it!**

## Image Requirements:

- **Format**: PNG (preferred) or JPG
- **Resolution**: At least 1920x1080 for clarity
- **File size**: Under 1MB (GitHub displays it faster)
- **Background**: White or transparent

## Alternative: Use the diagram you already have

If you have the diagram from the screenshot, save it as:
- `docs/architecture-diagram.png`

Then it will show up in the README automatically!

## If the image doesn't show:

Make sure the file path is exactly:
```
docs/architecture-diagram.png
```

Not:
- `docs/Architecture-Diagram.png` (wrong capitalization)
- `architecture-diagram.png` (wrong location)
- `docs/diagram.png` (wrong filename)
