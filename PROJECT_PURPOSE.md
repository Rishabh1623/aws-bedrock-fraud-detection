## 💼 Business Value (Not Just Technical)

### The Problem You're Solving

**Real-world scenario:**
> "A financial company loses $10M annually to fraud. Their current rule-based system has 8% false positives, blocking 80,000 legitimate transactions and frustrating customers. They need a better solution."

**Your solution:**
> "I built an AI-powered fraud detection system using Amazon Bedrock RFT that:
> - Improved accuracy by 66% (72% → 94%)
> - Reduced false positives by 75% (8% → 2%)
> - Processes 10,000 transactions per second with <100ms latency
> - Saves $300K annually in manual review costs
> - Prevents $2M in fraud losses
> - Costs 95% less than using large foundation models"

**This is what gets you hired.**

## 🎤 Interview Impact

### What You Can Say

**Weak answer (most candidates):**
> "I deployed a website on AWS using EC2 and S3."

**Your answer:**
> "I architected a production-grade fraud detection platform using Amazon Bedrock's Reinforcement Fine-Tuning. The system processes 10,000 transactions per second with sub-100ms latency, deployed across multiple availability zones with auto-scaling. I used Terraform for infrastructure as code, implemented VPC isolation for security, and integrated 10+ AWS services. The solution achieved 66% accuracy improvement while reducing costs by 95% compared to large foundation models, delivering $2.3M in annual business value."

**You immediately stand out.**
